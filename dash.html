            <p>We all have biases, and not only in our professional lives. And we all encounter unconscious bias on a day-to-day basis.</p>
            <p>From early childhood we learn to categorise people and make instant judgements. These are based on our socialisation and experiences, including exposure to the media. This results in unintentional preferences and positive and negative stereotypes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>Look at these images: what conclusions might you draw about that person, their attitude, lifestyle and job?</p>
            <h2>Example one</h2>
